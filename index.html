                <p>Hello! My name is Chris Ferenci. I am pursuing my Master's degree in Information Management and Systems at the University of California, Berkeley. </p>
                <p>Over the past 7 years, I have worked mostly as a Product and User Experience designer. My journey in technology started in 2015 as the Creative Director for Mobile First Studios, a digital agency specializing in the design and development of consumer web and mobile products. One year later in 2016, I joined environmental and geospatial software giant ESRI, desiging and researching user experiences across their entire mobile suite. Then, from 2017 to 2021, I led design efforts at TicketManager, an event management and client entertainment SaaS solution. There I pioneered a full platform redesign across their web, mobile, and Salesforce products.</p>
                <p>Now, at University of California, Berkeley, I'm studying management and emerging technologies in the health, biosensing, and wearables space. The future of wearable technology is incredibly exciting, and I believe there remain many opportunities for designers to make an impact.</p>
